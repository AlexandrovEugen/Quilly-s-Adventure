# QuillyJumper

This is a streaming project on twitch.tv/quillraven

We are going to develop a simple vertical platformer using LibGDX, Kotlin and LibKTX extensions.
In addition we will use Tiled as a mapeditor, box2d as a physic engine and ashley as our entity component system.

More information will follow once the project is growing a little bit bigger ;)
